In your script, you'll load the credentials from the JSON file located in the credentials directory:


import pandas as pd
import gspread
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import os

# Get the path to the directory where your script is located
script_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Load service account credentials from the JSON file
credentials_path = os.path.join(script_directory, "credentials", "your_credentials.json")
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    credentials_path,
    scopes=[
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"
    ]
)

# Now you can use the credentials to create connections
conn = connect(credentials=credentials)
client = gspread.authorize(credentials)
